This is my implementation of the walkSAT algorithm on '.dimacs' files
You can run the code either on debugger or on your terminal. 
As you can see you can handle the file both inside and outside of the code. Choose which way serves you best by commenting out the other one.
Note## 
You can set the number of maxFlips either by assign it as a parameter to the walksat function (line 125) or by importing it. Choose which way serves you best by commenting out the other one# my-walkSAT-on-.dimacs-files

problem.dimacs and problem1.dimacs are random generated problems that I used# my-walkSAT-on-.dimacs-files
